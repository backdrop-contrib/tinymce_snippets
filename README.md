# TinyMCE snippets

TinyMCE plugin to insert pre-defined snippets into content, using a dialog.

![Preview in dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/backdrop-contrib/tinymce_snippets/1.x-1.x/screenshots/preview-in-dialog.webp)

When editors should be able to insert structured content, styled snippets,
or the like, only by selecting from a list of available options, but this
content should be fully editable, this plugin is for you.

Maybe comparable to CKEditor templates, but with admin interface and token
 support for snippets (global tokens, they get replaced on preview/insert).

No coding skills necessary to create and administer snippets.
